# Business Insights App

This project was generated from a consolidated markdown export and made buildable with Vite + React + TypeScript.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   npm install
2. Configure environment variables:
   cp .env.example .env
3. Start development server:
   npm run dev
4. Build production bundle:
   npm run build

## Notes

- Some routes are placeholders because the original consolidated file referenced those pages but did not include full source code.
- The POS page is wired and uses Supabase tables such as `products`, `transactions`, and `pos_line_items`.
